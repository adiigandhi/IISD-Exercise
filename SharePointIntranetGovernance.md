# IISD SharePoint Intranet Governance

## Background
The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) maintains its intranet as primary internal communication tool. The IISD intranet supports organisational performance and individual practice. Its content enables IISD to standardise the approach toward the attainment of goals, values and objectives.

All employees are in charge of thoroughly understanding and observing any applicable Intranet sites. Use of or reliance on Intranet pages that have not been approved in accordance with this policy puts the business and its employees at risk.

## Policy Statement
- ### Summary 

   The IISD Intranet Governance structure, which is described in this policy and its supplementary publications, is to be used to advance all intranet content to publication.

    The following are the main tenets of the IISD Intranet Governance: 
    1. All information must be current and evaluated on a regular basis
    2. Wherever possible, source materials are hyperlinked
    3. little informational substance without repetition
    4. Primary views show the users' functional requirements

    All employees are encouraged to find and suggest the correction, removal, or deletion of intranet content that is outdated, unnecessary, or already available elsewhere.

- ### Docuement and content management

    Content for intranet must:
    - represent the goals, objectives, and strategic aim of IISD.
    - a connection to pertinent standards, regulations, and directives from the State Government, the Federal Government, and international organizations
    - specify the duties and obligations
    - should be succinct and written in language and terms that the intended audience would understand.
    - encourage and assist employees in providing excellent customer service
    - promote productive and efficient work methods
    - aid in the process of ongoing evaluation and development.

    Intranet pages should be automatically hidden from view or deleted if necessary if they haven't been inspected and updated in the last 24 months.
